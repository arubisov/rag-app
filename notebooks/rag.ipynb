    "Large language models (LLMs) have undoubtedly changed the way we interact with information. However, they come with their fair share of limitations as to what we can ask of them. Base LLMs (ex. Llama-2-70b, gpt-4, etc.) are only aware of the information that they've been trained on and will fall short when we require them to know information beyond that. Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) based LLM applications address this exact issue and extend the utility of LLMs and their generative reasoning abilities to our unique datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide, we're going to build a RAG-based LLM application where we will incorporate external data sources to augment our LLM’s capabilities. Specifically, we will be building an assistant that can answer questions about [Ray](https://github.com/ray-project/ray) — a Python framework for productionizing and scaling ML workloads. The goal here is to make it easier for developers to adopt Ray, but also, as we'll see in this guide, to help improve our Ray documentation itself and provide a foundation for other LLM applications. We’ll also share challenges we faced along the way and how we overcame them.\n",

    "Besides just building our LLM application, we’re also going to be focused on scaling and serving it in production. Unlike traditional machine learning, or even supervised deep learning, scale is a bottleneck for LLM applications from the very beginning. Large datasets, models, compute intensive workloads, serving requirements, etc. We’ll develop our application to be able to handle any scale as the world around us continues to grow. We’re also going to be focused on evaluation and performance. Our application involves many moving pieces: embedding models, chunking logic, the LLM itself, etc. and so it's important that we experiment with different configurations to optimize for the best quality responses. However, it's non-trivial to evaluate and quantitatively compare different configurations for a generative task. We’re going to break down evaluation of individual parts of our application (retrieval given query, generation given source), also assess the overall performance (end-to-end generation) and share findings towards an optimized configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: We'll be experimenting with different LLMs (OpenAI, Llama, etc.) in this guide. You will need [OpenAI credentials](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) to access [ChatGPT models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/) and [Anyscale Endpoints](https://endpoints.anyscale.com/) (hosted/private endpoints available) to serve + fine-tune OSS LLMs."

    "Now that we've created small chunks from our sections, we need a way to identify the most relevant ones for a given query. A very effective and quick method is to embed our data using a pretrained model and use the same model to embed the query. We can then compute the distance between all of the chunk embeddings and our query embedding to determine the top-k chunks. There are many different pretrained models to choose from to embed our data but the most popular ones can be discovered through [HuggingFace's Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard) leaderboard. These models were pretrained on very large text corpus through tasks such as next/masked token prediction which allowed them to learn to represent subtokens in N dimensions and capture semantic relationships. We can leverage this to represent our data and identify the most relevant contexts to use to answer a given query. We're using Langchain's Embedding wrappers ([HuggingFaceEmbeddings](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/embeddings/langchain.embeddings.huggingface.HuggingFaceEmbeddings.html) and [OpenAIEmbeddings](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/embeddings/langchain.embeddings.openai.OpenAIEmbeddings.html)) to easily load the models and embed our document chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: embeddings aren't the only way to determine the more relevant chunks. We could also use an LLM to decide! However, because LLMs are much larger than these embedding models and have maximum context lengths, it's better to use embeddings to retrieve the top k chunks. And then we could use LLMs on the fewer k chunks to determine the <k chunks to use as the context to answer our query. We could also use reranking (ex. [Cohere Rerank](https://txt.cohere.com/rerank/)) to further identify the most relevant chunks to use. We could also combine embeddings with traditional information retrieval methods such as keyword matching, which could be useful for matching for unique tokens that may potentially be lost when embedding subtokens."

    "So far with all of our approaches, we've used an embedding model (+ lexical search) to identify the top k relevant chunks in our dataset. The number of chunks (k) has been a small number because we found that adding too many chunks did not help and our LLMs have restricted context lengths. However, this was all under the assumption that the top k retrieved chunks were truly the most relevant chunks and that their order was correct as well. What if increasing the number of chunks didn't help because some relevant chunks were much lower in the ordered list. And, semantic representations, while very rich, were not trained for this specific task. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll implement reranking so that we can use our semantic and lexical search methods to cast a much wider net over our dataset (retrieve many chunks) and then rerank the order based on the user's query. The intuition here is that we can account for gaps in our semantic representations with ranking specific to our use case. We'll train a supervised model that predicts which part of our [documentation](https://docs.ray.io/) is most relevant for a given user's query. We'll use this prediction to then rerank the relevant chunks so that chunks from this part of our documentation are moved to the top of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: We also experimented with [cross-encoders](https://www.sbert.net/docs/pretrained_cross-encoders.html) which processes the query and the relevant contexts together with the same model. This allows for a more contextual representation compared to cosine distance but it's also more computationally expensive. So we followed a similar approach of using the similarity distance first to extract many chunks and then use the cross-encoder to rerank and choose the top k chunks. Unfortunately, this approach didn't improve our quality as the technique below does but it's worth fine-tuning our cross-encoder using our synthetic embedding QA dataset.\n",

We're going to use [Ray Serve](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/index.html) with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) to develop and scale our service. First, we'll define some data structures like `Query` and `Answer` to represent the inputs and outputs to our service. We will also define a small function to load our index (assumes that the respective SQL dump file already exists). Finally, we can define our `QueryAgent` and use it to serve `POST` requests with the query. And we can serve our agent at any deployment scale we wish using the [@serve.deployment](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/api/doc/ray.serve.Deployment.html) decorator where we can specify the number of replicas, compute resources, etc."
